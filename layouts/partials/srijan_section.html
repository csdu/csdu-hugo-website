		Srijan is the annual magazine of Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi. It is launched every year at Sankalan.
	</p>
	<p>
		Srijan translates to ‘creation’. In the context of this magazine, it is the creation of new ideas, advancements and technologies in computer science and its allied disciplines.
	</p>
	<p>
		Begun with the aim of presenting the latest developments in technology concisely, Srijan has since evolved to provide not only a complete roundup of the emerging tech and research but also examine their consequential social and psychological effects. With the intent to create a comprehensive journal unravelling the mysteries behind mind-boggling innovations, we present the most exciting inventions of 2020.
	</p>
	<p>
		And since all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, we also showcase the key co-curricular activities at DUCS, highlighting glimpses of annual events held on campus.
	</p>
	<p>
		This year, Srijan showcases novel technologies being developed around the world, while also elucidating advances made in existing ones. Innovations gaining rapid integration in society are examined, and the magazine speaks of all the current development in computer science around the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		Department of Computer Science takes immense pleasure to announce volume-10 of Srijan successfully, with all new enthusiasm and zeal towards a new era of computer science.
